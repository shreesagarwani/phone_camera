# phone_camera
Using a phone camera with Python is very useful for those who are planning to create computer vision apps that will use a smartphone camera as a part of your application. Here We will be using Python on Windows 10.

The process of using a phone camera with Python:

First, install the OpenCV library in Python; pip install opencv-python.
Download and install the IP Webcam application on your smartphones.
After installing the IP Webcam app, make sure your phone and PC are connected to the same network. Run the app on your phone and click Start Server.
After that, your camera will open with an IP address at the bottom. Copy the IP address as we will need to use it in our Python code to open your phone’s camera.

#In a few moments, an OpenCV window will appear and do the rest. To close the window, just press any key. This is how to connect a phone’s camera with Python for computer vision applications. The next step on how to use this feature depends on how you want to use it.
